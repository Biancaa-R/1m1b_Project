* Immersive learning through Virtual Reality and Gamification
Ideal Case Senario: Hook students up to a VR headset in class and attend it in the VR World.
Not a replacement of classes, rather a replacement of the classic chalk board and notebook teaching.
Facilitating learning and provide hands on experiences even when they lack the resources

** Positives
- Bringing immersive learning to schools in an innovative way.
- Letting children gasp abstract and practical concepts more easily.
  + By Visuallizing said concepts in a VR Class.

** Negatives
- The technology may cause children to overuse it
- More screen time
- Issues associated with long hours of using vr
-price issue for unprevileged
- Teachers from non tech background may find difficulty

* Concepts
** Subjects coverage
Have a sandbox where they can build their own experiments and interact in their free time, share with eachother and learn.
Get Children excited about... tech?
*** Science
+ Visualizing Atoms
+ Combustion Engines
+ Electric Diagrams
+Under water corals sea,reefs
+ Biological life, evolution, aquatic life

*** Social sciences
+ Civilizations eg Mohenjadaro,harapa,arikemedu
+ Historical Events 
+ great wars in history
+ Museums
+wind directions,wave or tide flow directions that is usually difficult to comprehend

*** Abstract Concepts
+ Mathamatical calculations
  - Arithmetic
  - Volume and Suface Area
+ Music Theory (cant elaborate, I only play the guitar for fun)

** Building said Class
*** Hardware
- VR Headsets
- Decision of handheld controllers or HoloLens style control
*** Software
+ Would need to build a proof of concept in Unity (requires basic C# and 'creative problem solving'?) - 5 hours to learn Unity + VR builds (ie 3D world building)
+ Graphics in Blender (Requires 3D designing abilities) - 3 hours to learn minimum
  - Could also just build a 2D concept sketch version if less time?

+ 'Concept Shop' - Similar to something like the (Microsoft store)? for students categorized by Concepts
  + Children can then create their own games using said concepts the way they do in [[https://indreams.me/][Indreams]] (Looks comfortable for VR building elaborate to not say Indreams)
